            <h2>Eduardo Uchoa</h2>
            <p>Eduardo Uchoa is a Full Professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil and 
              holds an INRIA International Chair (2022-2026) in France. He is a prominent figure in 
              the development of modern Branch-Cut-and-Price algorithms. His work is notable for both 
              its theoretical contributions and computational achievements, time and again advancing 
              the boundaries of solvability in classic problems. Eduardo is one of the principal 
              architects of VRPSolver, a generic Column Generation-based algorithm that currently 
              achieves state-of-the-art exact results for a wide spectrum of vehicle routing 
              problems and other problem classes.</p>

            <h2>Artur Pessoa</h2>
            <p>Artur Pessoa is an Associate Professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil 
              and a "hidden figure" (rarely attending international conferences) in numerous 
              column generation developments. He is also one of the principal creators of VRPSolver. 
              Artur is an exceptional programmer with a comprehensive knowledge of mathematical 
              optimization. In addition to his work on classic deterministic combinatorial 
              optimization problems, Artur has made significant contributions to non-linear, 
              bi-level, and stochastic optimization.</p>

            <h2>Lorenza Moreno</h2>
            <p>Lorenza Moreno is an Associate Professor at Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora 
              in Brazil. She has extensive experience in applied optimization for industry, 
              having worked on tactical and operational railway planning, telecom network 
              design, industrial scheduling, and logistics for some of the biggest Brazilian 
              companies. Her advanced column generation-based solution for helicopter transport 
              of oil rig crews in the Campos Basin was a finalist for the INFORMS Daniel H. 
              Wagner Prize for Excellence in the Practice of Operations Research.</p>
